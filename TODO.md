# To-do

* Bayes Factors, possibly with SMC sampling: https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/Bayes_factor.html
* Posterior Predictive, possibly sampling along with posterior: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/169223/how-to-generate-the-posterior-predictive-distribution-for-hierarchal-model-in-py
* Plotting sample dose-response curves, from both Post. and Post. Pred.
* Another other MCMC analysis figures we want to include
* Summary statistics / compression? Possibly impractical so save loads of samples from each chain, etc.
* Add option to model as "channel block" or "conductance scale", and choose the appropriate model/function
